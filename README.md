### Hi there :robot:

I'm a PhD student in Applied Mathematics, at the Inria Quantic team. 

I am working in collaboration with the Laboratoire Kartier Brossel (LKB). My project is to develop quantum control strategies for a superconducting qubit coupled to a mechanical resonator.

My research interests include Open Quantum Systems, Many-Body and Statistical Mechanics. I am also passionate about Tensor Network methods.
