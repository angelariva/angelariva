:robot:  I'm a PhD student in Applied Mathematics at the Inria Quantic team in Paris, France. Before that I studied in Milan, Italy. 

🔍 My primary research area is Open Quantum Systems theory.

In my work, I explore quantum systems with both physical and technological applications in mind with 

📝  analytical methods (like time convolutionless master equations and adiabatic elimination) 

💻  numerical methods (such as tensor networks for Spin-Boson models, efficient simulation of Lindblad equations, and SDPs).


🔵─🔴─🟢─🟡 I'm also interested in Many Body theory.
