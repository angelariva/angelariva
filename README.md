I'm a PhD student in Applied Mathematics at the Inria [Quantic team](https://quantic.phys.ens.fr/) in Paris, France. 

My primary research area is **open quantum systems theory**. I work with analytical (time convolutionless master equations, adiabatic elimination) and numerical methods (tensor networks for Spin-Boson models, efficient simulation of Lindblad equations, SDPs).

I'm also interested in many-body theory (ðŸ”µâ”€ðŸ”´â”€ðŸŸ¢â”€ðŸŸ¡ especially simulations of fermionic models), and in collaborations!
