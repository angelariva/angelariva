I'm a PhD student in Applied Mathematics at the Inria Quantic team in Paris, France. Before that I studied in Milan, Italy. 

My primary research area is Open Quantum Systems theory 🔍, with both physical and technological applications in mind. I work with 

- analytical methods 📝 (like time convolutionless master equations and adiabatic elimination) 

- numerical methods 💻 (such as tensor networks for Spin-Boson models, efficient simulation of Lindblad equations, and SDPs).


I'm also interested in Many Body theory (🔵─🔴─🟢─🟡 especially tensor network simulations), and in collaborations!
